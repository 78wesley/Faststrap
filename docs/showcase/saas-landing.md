# SaaS Landing Page

A modern SaaS landing page template that demonstrates how to combine Phase 4 components into a conversion-oriented marketing site.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Hero Activation
Uses the `Hero` component with `align="start"` and custom button groups to create a professional splash section.

### 📊 Metric Display
Demonstrates the `StatCard` component to show platform health, including trend indicators (e.g., `+15%` or `-2s`).

### 🧩 FAQ with Accordion
Uses the `Accordion` component in `flush` mode to handle detailed questions in a space-efficient way.

### 🛠️ Feature Grids
Combines `Grid`, `Col`, and `Icon` to build a standard 3-column feature section.
