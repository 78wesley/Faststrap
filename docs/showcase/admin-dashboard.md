# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard showcase demonstrates how FastStrap components power complex internal tools and data-heavy applications.

## Key Features

### 📈 KPI Overview
A responsive grid of `StatCard` components providing real-time insights into revenue, users, and server health.

### 📑 Tabular Data
A full implementation of the `Table` system, including:
- **THead/TBody**: Logical separation of headers and data.
- **Responsive Classes**: Using `striped` and `hover` variants.
- **Component Injection**: Embedding `Badge` and `Button` directly into table cells.

### 🏛️ Structural Cards
Using the `Card` component as a layout container for tables and system health reports.
